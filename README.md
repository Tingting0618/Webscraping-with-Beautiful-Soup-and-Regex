# Webscraping-with-Beautiful-Soup-and-Regex

The purpose of this exercise is to use beautifulsoup to extract out information from this article: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/09/13/mcdonalds-states-most-stores/37748287/.

Unfortunately, the information we want is not stored in a table and is not formatted in a way that makes it easy to extract, so it will take some work before you can do any analysis.

Your objective is to create a pandas DataFrame containing all 50 states and the four metrics from the article (number of McDonald's per 100,000, adult obesity rate, percent consuming vegetables less than daily, and median household income).
